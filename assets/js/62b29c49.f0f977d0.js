I\u2019m incredibly proud of the dedication and hard work my team put into every step of product development\u2014whether it was perfecting the user experience, creating new products, or expanding applications. Two years ago, my VP advised me to treat the team (which was only four people at the time) as a startup.

There\u2019s a much shorter distance between the product team and the end user either when we cook or promote the product. This close connection makes it easy for us to collaborate and continuously improve the product. I believe a big reason for this is that our products are open-source, designed to be developed, and customized, \u2014 that\u2019s different from commercial products. Working with global developers feels like a unique opportunity, not just to improve our products, but to co-create with them.

Although it\u2019s too early to call it a strategic shift, I do feel like we\u2019ve uncovered something worth exploring further in the coming year. While in the Bay Area, I had the privilege of meeting some truly inspiring people. At Founders Inc., an incubator located in the beautiful Yacht Harbor in San Francisco, we met founders who are driven by an unwavering sense of mission and passion. Eric, our CEO and founder, described his first impression of meeting two of founders with one word: "Unstoppable." That word resonated deeply with me.
